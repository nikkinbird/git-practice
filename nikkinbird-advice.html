                <h4>Being new at something is always awkward</h4>
                <p>Let yourself be a new learner, even if it's frustrating. When learning a new skill, it can be hard to remember what it's like to do something for the first time. You may be really good at other things, or used to picking up new skills quickly, so it can be easy to give up on something that doesn't come so easily. Don't give up! Every little bit that you learn and practice builds up, and eventually, you'll be good at this too.</p>

                <h4>It's okay to come back to something after a long break</h4>
                <p>Maybe you tried learning to code awhile ago, but then life got in the way and you had to take a break. Yeah, you probably forgot some stuff between then and now, and will need reminding, but that doesn't mean that all your previous learning has gone to waste! Even if you have to re-do some lessons, or start from square one on some topics, I'll bet you'll find that it's gotten a little easier since the last time you worked on it, and some concepts will be reinforced by going over it again!</p>
