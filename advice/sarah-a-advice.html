                <h4>It's okay to feel lost and overwhelmed.</h4>
                <p>It's likely, that outside of putting &hearts;'s all over your MySpace page, you've never done any of this before.</p>

                <p>You're choosing to step out of your comfort zone to learn something brand new. That's brave as hell, and no easy feat. I'm willing to bet you (like me!) also have a full time job to maintain while trying to fit these studies in.</p>

                <p>It's okay to take a break if you hit a wall or get frustrated. Step away, do some yoga, snuggle your pets, take a walk. Don't burn yourself out. Technology ain't goin' anywhere, it'll be here when you get back.</p>
                <p><strong> ASK FOR HELP!</strong> E-mail your instructors, turn to YouTube, ask a tech-savvy friend. You don't have to figure everything out on your own.</p>

                <h4>Getting started is the hardest part.</h4>
                <p>Despite having a computer teacher for a father, I have literally never been interested in anything related to computers or technology, and have <strong>zero</strong> experience with it. When I started thinking about trying my hand at coding, I absolutely exerienced self-doubt and imposter syndrome. Don't listen to those negative thoughts! You're as welcome in the tech world as anyone else.</p>

                <p>I certainly have days when I think, "But I don't <strong>WANNA</strong> practice coding today!" And then as soon as I sit down and get started, I go on a roll for hours. Try to stay motivated, even when you think you don't want to sit down and work on your skills. You'll be glad you did, at the end of the day.</p>

                <p> Remember that every time to sit down to learn and practice, you're one step closer to your dream career.</p>
