                <h4>Don't be afraid to make mistakes</h4>
                <p>Some of my best learning is done when i've mucked something up and i need to find a solution.  It sometimes seems scary to delve into a solution without guidance but this is a necessary part of learning.</p>
 		<h4>Stubbornness is a great quality for a programmer </h4>
                <p>Don't give up on a solution.  It is out there somewhere and all of the time spent finding the solution is not wasted time - it results in valuable learning and development. </p>
